<h1>Why</h1>
<p>
	On my first job in a small office, my employer needed to be able to take content from other articles
	and be able to make it his own. I do not condone this behavior, but at the time I had no other job offer
	as I had no job experience either. At this point, he was the only person paying me and I needed money to
	pay for my tuition. I believe he needed this application to help him generate blog sites to push SEO
	to his main websites. (Grey hat SEO is what I believe it's called).
</p>

<h1>What</h1>
<p>
	It's a minimal application using the NodeJS/ExpressJS, MongoDB, and AngularJS.
