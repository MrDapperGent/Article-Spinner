Article-Spinner

===============

Allows users to enter text and replaces words with synonyms to generate new text.

<h1>What Works Right Now</h1>
<p>
	Strictly in development. The only feature that works is the unit test for the Spin module, which submits a word, a sentence, and a paragraph. The unit test checks if the "spun" content matches the previously predicted content.
</p>
<h2>Future Updates</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Synonyms based on parts of speech. For example, currently a noun might be swapped for an adjective.</li>
	<li>Entering plain text. For example, currently the test suite only accepts variables, arrays, and 2D arrays for words, sentences, and paragraphs.</li>
	<li>Possibly a CL application or GUI for non-technical users</li>
</ul>
